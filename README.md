# Handwritten_Captcha_Detection-
## Overview
The program is a sophisticated machine learning application that converts handwritten captchas, which consist of English letters and emojis assigned to specific numbers, into plain text. By utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the program is able to accurately recognize and translate the characters in the captchas. OpenCV is employed for advanced image processing tasks, such as resizing, normalization, noise reduction, and binarization, ensuring that the input images are in the optimal format for the CNN to process. This combination of deep learning and image processing allows the program to effectively decipher handwritten captchas with high accuracy.
